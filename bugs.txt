I don't know for sure whether these requests are related to each other or not. For example I created a user (POST "/api/users") and try to get it out (GET "/api/users" or "/api/users/id"), but my user doesn't exist there. This is an error if these requests are related and use common storage.

The same applies to the user's login. I receive a token with any user. This is clearly wrong.
